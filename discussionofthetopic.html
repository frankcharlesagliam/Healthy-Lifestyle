            <p style="font-family:arial; text-align:justify">
                A healthy lifestyle benefits our bodily and emotional well-being, as well as our social relationships. 
				A healthy lifestyle entails eating a balanced diet and exercising regularly, abstaining from tobacco and narcotics, and obtaining adequate rest. 
				It should involve adequate rest, particularly sleep. Not only is good health the absence of sickness or illness, but it is also a state of whole physical,
				mental, and social well-being. Our bodies operate similarly to machines, requiring a balance of protein, carbs, fat, vitamins, minerals, and water to function properly.
				If your balance is off, your health will suffer. A balanced diet entails consuming no more calories than you burn during the day.
				If you consume more calories than you burn, any surplus will be stored as fat.

            <p style="font-family:arial; text-align:justify"> We frequently spend extravagantly on the development of exotic pharmaceuticals 
			and other forms of treatment for diseases, rather than attempting to prevent them. People worldwide are spending an increasing amount of 
			time engaging in sedentary activities. We spend the majority of our free time sitting: on a computer or other gadget, watching television,
			or playing video games. When you lead an inactive lifestyle, you burn fewer calories, increasing your risk of weight gain; 
			you may lose muscle strength and endurance as a result of less muscle use; your bones may become weaker and lose some mineral content;
			your metabolism may be affected, causing your body to have difficulty breaking down fats and sugars. 
			Inactivity is a risk factor for a variety of chronic diseases. You increase your risk of obesity, heart disease, 
			including coronary artery disease and heart attack, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol if you do not engage in regular exercise.

            <p style=" font-family:arial; text-align:justify">A healthy lifestyle is one that minimizes the chance of becoming seriously ill or dying
			prematurely. While not all diseases are preventable, a substantial share of deaths, particularly those caused by coronary heart disease 
			and lung cancer, are avoidable. Certain types of behavior have been linked to the development of noncommunicable diseases and premature
			death in scientific investigations. Health is much more than disease prevention. Additionally, it pertains to physical, mental, and 
			social well-being. When a healthy lifestyle is embraced, it creates a more favorable role model for other family members, particularly
			children.

					and look younger, but it extends beyond that. For instance, maintaining proper hydration and sleep can help minimize the 
					appearance of under-eye bags. Limiting alcohol use and abstaining from smoke both help to slow the aging process of your skin 
					and eyes. Proper nutrition from a balanced diet also provides the nutrients your body requires for healthy and lustrous hair, 
					bright eyes, taut skin, and an overall shine. Maintaining a healthy lifestyle is not about impressing others, particularly 
					on social media, but it is about caring for your body and ensuring your health. It's a way for you to care for and appreciate
					your body. On the other hand, there are a few simple steps you may take to begin living a healthier lifestyle. 
					This does not suggest that you must eliminate all cravings or wants for food; rather, it aims to assist you in limiting 
					your consumption of unhealthy foods. Including vegetables in your diet is preferable.

			<h6 style="color:#DAA520; font-size:30px"><i>What is Mental Health?</i></h6>
			<p style="font-family:arial; text-align:justify"> While it may appear straightforward to describe mental health as the absence of mental
			illness, the majority of professionals agree that being mentally healthy entails more. The Surgeon General of the United States defines
			mental health as "a state of good mental function that results in productive activities, rewarding interpersonal connections, and the
			capacity to adapt to change and overcome adversity." Mental health is an enviable state, given the benefits it provides. For example,
			mentally healthy persons report having the fewest health-related constraints on their daily activities, missing the fewest days of work
			completely or partially, and having the healthiest social functioning (for example, low helplessness, clear life goals, high resilience,
			and high levels of intimacy in their lives).

								hopelessness, and increased or decreased sleep, appetite, and/or weight. The person might also exhibit thoughts, 
								plans, or attempts to harm themselves. Women with postpartum depression tend to experience many of the above symptoms
